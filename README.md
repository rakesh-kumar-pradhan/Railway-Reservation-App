## Railway-Reservation-App

This is an example application to demonstrate how we can manage login/registration flow in our React app with Redux.

## Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/rakesh-kumar-pradhan/Railway-Reservation-App.git
npm intall
npm start
```
## Run Server
To communication with our React application I created a fake rest api with the power of [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) library.
To run the server just do:
```
npm run api
```
